## About üìñ

Monkeytype Hack is a python script that automates typing with speeds up to "Infinity" WPM on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/). It uses the `selenium` library to simulate keypresses and the `time` library to control the speed of typing.

- Note: after 30 seconds, remember to go back to the monkeytype window if you are using the script in the background. Otherwise, the script will fail to detect the WPM.
